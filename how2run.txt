For default run
[JW baroclinic wave test, glevel 5 (220km), rlevel 1 (40 regions), 8 CPUs]

Step 1:
See requirements and setup your environment.

Step 2:
cd pynicamdc/nhm/driver/

Step 3:
mpiexec -n 8 python3 -u driver-dc.py

Step 4:
Open jupyter lab and quicklook with daskzarr_out-simple.ipynb
by default, the output will be "testout_tmp.zarr" 
Run will fail if testout_tmp.zarr pre-exists (remove or rename before running again)
